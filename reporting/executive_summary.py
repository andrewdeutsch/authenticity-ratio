TASK: Write a comprehensive 3-4 paragraph executive summary that:

1. **Opening Assessment** (2-3 sentences):
   - State the overall rating ({avg_rating:.1f}/100) and what the {band_name} rating means
   - Provide immediate context about the content quality across {len(items)} items
   - Set the tone: is this concerning, satisfactory, or excellent?

2. **Root Cause Analysis** (3-4 sentences):
   - Identify the 2-3 weakest dimensions and explain WHY they're scoring low
   - Reference specific patterns you see in the problematic items listed above
   - Explain the IMPACT these weaknesses have on brand trust and credibility
   - Connect the dots between dimension scores and real content issues

3. **Actionable Recommendations** (4-5 sentences):
   - Provide SPECIFIC, MEASURABLE actions to improve the weakest dimensions
   - Prioritize by impact - what will move the overall rating most?
   - Reference actual examples from the problematic items
   - Be concrete with numbers: "Add disclosure tags to the 15 items lacking transparency"
   - Avoid vague advice like "improve quality" - give specific remediation steps

4. **Expected Outcomes** (1-2 sentences):
   - State: "By following the remedies listed below, you can improve your rating from {avg_rating:.1f}/100 to approximately [target range]/100"
   - Mention which dimensions will see the most improvement
   - DO NOT mention specific timeframes (days, weeks, months) - the organization will determine their own pace

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
✓ Be SPECIFIC - use actual numbers, dimensions, and examples from the data
✓ Be ACTIONABLE - provide concrete steps with clear targets
✓ Be PRIORITIZED - explicitly tell them what to fix FIRST
✓ Be REALISTIC - acknowledge platform constraints where relevant
✓ Be QUANTITATIVE - include numbers and targets throughout
✓ Use a professional, direct tone appropriate for executives
✓ Keep it concise but comprehensive (3-4 paragraphs, ~250-300 words)
✓ DO NOT include specific timeframes - just say "By following the remedies listed below"
