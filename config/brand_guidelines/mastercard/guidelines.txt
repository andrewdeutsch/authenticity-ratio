An introduction to the Mastercard Foundation’s 
brand architecture
We’re building a stronger 
Mastercard Foundation brand
Over the last few years, the Mastercard Foundation  
has made a series of strategic decisions to accelerate  
its mission and ensure that meaningful impact is 
achieved through its work in Africa and across  
Indigenous communities in Canada.
We have an opportunity to use brand architecture as 
a strategic lever to clearly articulate the breadth and 
depth of who we are and what we do, to improve brand 
consistency and clarity, and to bring added value to  
our stakeholders.
This section outlines our brand architecture strategy.  
The brand architecture for the Mastercard Foundation 
serves as the cornerstone for how we organize and 
represent our portfolio of work. It also demonstrates 
how to visually treat the various parts of our work, 
including programs, events, publications, and third-
party relationships to ensure our brand is appropriately 
represented. 
What is brand architecture?
• A visual illustration to guide how the Foundation is represented and 
to help people understand and navigate who we are and what we do.
What should brand architecture do?
• Communicate the Mastercard Foundation’s priorities and objectives.
• Highlight how all of the parts come together to drive a bigger impact.
• Achieve clarity and efficiency with a more consistent visual approach.
• Strengthen the brand value by providing a clear visual hierarchy.
• Support an understanding of how the Foundation partners with 
other organizations.

Mastercard Foundation logo:
• Maintains focus on the Mastercard 
Foundation brand to build long-term 
brand value.
• Provides “leadership” messaging 
through the use of blue-based colour 
in sub-heads.
• Supports global disability standards 
by providing enough colour contrast  
in sub-heads.
• Reduces the number of independent 
sub-brands to improve consistency 
and efficiency.
Program, event, and publication names:
• Improves brand consistency by 
removing complexity and confusion  
in the use of multiple program brands.
• Supports the building of brand 
value and awareness of the 
Foundation brand.
Co-branded partnerships:
• Accurately represents the relationship 
between the Mastercard Foundation 
and the Program.
• Allows appropriate recognition for  
the contribution.• As descriptors, they highlight various 
levels of engagement and provide 
consistency in how we explain 
Foundation partnerships and support 
(e.g., In partnership with  …).
• Please note that the Mastercard 
Foundation logo or brand mark are 
not to be used on partner, programs, 
participants, or any third-party 
stakeholders’ social media platforms 
and messages. However, the 
Foundation’s social media handles 
can be tagged in relevant and 
applicable social messages  
and hashtags.
Distinct visual treatment:
• Uses intentional design cues (e.g., 
core colour, bold typography, 
colourful imagery, prominent 
shapes or outlined areas) to help 
build awareness and trust in the 
Foundation brand.
• Enables easier implementation with 
limited resources and avoids having to 
work on a case-by-case basis, thereby 
creating more efficiency and quicker 
turnaround times.Visual treatment  
of communicationsAll visual examples are for illustrative purposes only.
Unlock (create sufficient free space) 
around the Mastercard Foundation 
logo from programs, events, and 
publications to create a clear visual 
hierarchy.Use descriptors to signal 
the relationship and  
level of engagement in  
co-branded partnerships.

The Mastercard Foundation and IDH partner 
to strengthen Ghana’s grain market with 
‘Grains for Growth’ program
Accra, Ghana, 6th April 2022 – the Mastercard Foundation and IDH - The Sustainable Trade 
Initiative, today announced the launch of an innovative partnership, dubbed Grains for Growth, to 
transform Ghana’s grains market.
The Program aims to develop inclusive, and economically viable grain-supply chains that will offer 
employment and entrepreneurship opportunities, contribute to better incomes, and improve 
livelihoods of farmers, especially women and youth.
Over the next three-and-a-half-years, the Grains for Growth program will partner with a dozen 
small and medium- sized enterprises (SMEs) in northern Ghana, high-profile off-takers, and other 
supply chain actors,  to create 100,000 direct and indirect jobs across the maize, rice, millet, fonio, 
and sorghum supply chains with majority of these jobs targeting young Ghanaian women and men. 
The program will also support the inclusion of 20,000 smallholder farmers through optimized 
sourcing and service delivery structures, whilst aiming to  significantly increase incomes for 
participating farmers. 
Grain Production in Ghana
Grain production in the northern part of Ghana is largely characterized by informal supply chains, 
where actors have limited access to affordable financing solutions, mechanized services, and quality 
agro-inputs. These constraints negatively affect the quality and volumes of grain production and 
the ability of SMEs in the value chain, to attract and maintain premium-paying buyers resulting in 
limited commercial investments.

Create a grid of sizing lines to use as a visual guide to 
determine equal sizing. This is done by vertically dividing  
the Mastercard Foundation logo into 10 equal squares.
To ensure logos are sized optically equal,  use the sizing 
lines. First, place the partner logo on the same baseline as 
the Mastercard Foundation logo (bottom aligned). Then 
optically size the partner logos to the closest sizing lines.

Young Africa Works should act as a unifying 
strategy across all of the Foundation’s 
communications activities in Africa.
Please note the following:
• Use the hashtag “#YoungAfricaWorks” 
wherever appropriate to maintain focus  
on the Foundation’s strategy in relation  
to the brand.
• Young Africa Works will no longer be treated 
as a brand identity.
• Young Africa Works is a unifying strategy and 
is referred to as the Foundation’s strategic 
vision in all communications and should not be 
referred to as a program/platform brand.Young Africa Works’ role in the  
Mastercard Foundation’s brand architecture
Unite communications 
by referencing Young 
Africa Works as a 
hashtag (#).
When Young Africa 
Works is included as 
a program, event, or 
publication name, it 
should be treated in the 
same style as other  
program names.
When Young Africa 
Works is included as 
part of a title, it is set 
in the title area and

Understanding 
Disability & Inclusion Getting Started with Disability InclusionIn partnership with 
From 2013–2017, the Mastercard Foundation hosted an 
annual Symposium on Financial Inclusion (SoFI). The 
event promoted the idea that financial service providers 
in developing countries should focus more on the needs 
and expectations of people living in poverty to drive 
financial inclusion at scale. Every year, the theme of the 
Symposium was Clients at the Centre. Understanding 
the financial needs, worries, and aspirations of people 
living in poverty is the key to serving them effectively. 
Harnessing that understanding to create and deliver 
services and products that most effectively serve the 
unbanked poor is at the heart of client centricity.Young Africa Works

Exception to our  
brand architecture
Unlike other programs, events and publications, 
the Mastercard Foundation EleV Program will 
retain its identity. See Mastercard Foundation EleV 
Program Brand Guidelines
Rationale
• The Mastercard Foundation EleV Program 
identity was developed with Indigenous 
communities and program partner involvement.
• The logo contains a symbolic meaning/story that 
is important to young people and to Indigenous 
communities in Canada.
• Retaining the logo aligns with the Foundation’s 
values of respect, listening, and co-creation.
The EleV logo should appear optically equal in size 
to the Mastercard Foundation logo.  
See examples.The Mastercard Foundation EleV Program 
logo should appear optically equal to the 
Mastercard Foundation logo.
The Mastercard Foundation logo should be positioned 
to the left and the EleV Program logo to the right 
whenever possible.

“to live a good life”
Indigenous youth are powerful agents for their 
communities, Nations, and Canada as a whole.
About  the Mastercard Foundati on
Mas tercard Foundation seeks a world where everyone ha s 
the opportunity to learn and prosper. The Foundation 
works with visionary organizations to enab le young peopl e 
in Africa and in Indigenou s communities in Canada to access 
digniﬁed and fulﬁlling work. It is one of the largest, private 
foundations in the world with a mission to advance learning 
and promote ﬁnancial inclusion to create an inclusive 
and   equi table world. The Foundation was created by 
Mas tercard in 2006 as an independ ent organization  
with its own Board of Directors and management.
Education and employment are pathwa ys out of  poverty. 
The Mas tercard Foundation is working to ensure that 
millions of young peop le in Africa, the wo rld’s youngest 
continent , access quality educ ation,  ﬁnancial services, 
and meaningful work. In Canada, our work is focused on 
Indigenou s youth  – the  youngest,  fastest growing 
population in the country, a tremendo us source of 
opportunity impact, and leade rship.The EleV Program
Indigenou s youth are powerful agents  of change for  thei r 
communities, Nations, and Canada as a who le.
The Foundation launched the EleV Program in Canada  in 
2017 as a commi tment to Indigenou s youth to  support 
them in their pathways through education and on to 
meaningful work and livelihoods based on their values, 
traditions, and aspirations. Our vision is of Indigenou s 
young peop le living Mino Bimaadiziwin, a  concept in  the  
Anishinaabe language that means  “a good life” – a fulﬁlling, 
meaningful life consistent with one’s traditions and values. 
Our goal is for education an d employment systems to be 
transformed to enab le 30, 000 Indigenous young peopl e 
to access post-secondary education and transition to 
meani ngful  live lihoods by  2030.  They w ill drive lasting 
impact and change in their communities and across Canada. 
At this historic moment of reconciliation in Canada, it’s  
important to work and act together. Indigenou s youth 
have told us that education is a key life goal. They seek 
high-qualit y post-secondary education opportunities, close 
to their community wher ever possible, and aligned with 
EleV 
Network
Meeting 
For vertical applications where the EleV logo cannot 
be placed to the right of the Mastercard Foundation 
logo, the EleV logo should be placed in the bottom left 
opposite the Mastercard Foundation logo.1

Enterprise Toolkit
The Mastercard Foundation is committed to 
working closely with partners to ensure that 
communications efforts are aligned with each 
organization’s values and goals.
While the partnership is built on collaboration 
and shared values, it is essential that each 
organization’s brand retains its integrity and 
independence.
This Mastercard Foundation toolkit  ensures 
consistency and cohesion in language and style, 
and proper representation of brands within a 
partnership. The toolkit includes guidelines and 
messaging to assist partners in communicating 
about the Mastercard Foundation in a consistent 
way. Also included in the toolkit are a style guide, 
an overview of the review process, and guidelines 
for media, events, and photography.

across communications, we apply general scaling 
rules based on layout dimensions.
Note:  It’s important for our logo to be 
appropriately placed in all communications. 
This helps build equity across the Foundation’s 
programs, events, and publications while 
ensuring a consistent and prominent placement 
relative to name artwork.

• Span the width of the title.
• Be the same width as a lower-case “L”  
in a type size that matches the title.

Embrace the opportunity 
to design distinct support 
graphics for marquee  
events.When Young Africa 
Works Summit is 
included as a program, 
event, or publication 
name, it should be 
treated in the same

When Young Africa 
Works Summit is 
included as part of a 
title, it is set in the title 
area and treated as 
other titles. 
From 2013–2017, the Mastercard Foundation hosted an 
annual Symposium on Financial Inclusion (SoFI). The 
event promoted the idea that financial service providers 
in developing countries should focus more on the needs 
and expectations of people living in poverty to drive 
financial inclusion at scale. Every year, the theme of the 
Symposium was Clients at the Centre. Understanding 
the financial needs, worries, and aspirations of people 
living in poverty is the key to serving them effectively. 
Harnessing that understanding to create and deliver 
services and products that most effectively serve the 
unbanked poor is at the heart of client centricity.Young Africa Works

About  the Mastercard Foundati on
Mas tercard Foundation seeks a world where everyone ha s 
the opportunity to learn and prosper. The Foundation 
works with visionary organizations to enab le young peopl e 
in Africa and in Indigenou s communities in Canada to access 
digniﬁed and fulﬁlling work. It is one of the largest, private 
foundations in the world with a mission to advance learning 
and promote ﬁnancial inclusion to create an inclusive 
and   equi table world. The Foundation was created by 
Mas tercard in 2006 as an independ ent organization  
with its own Board of Directors and management.
Education and employment are pathwa ys out of  poverty. 
The Mas tercard Foundation is working to ensure that 
millions of young peop le in Africa, the wo rld’s youngest 
continent , access quality educ ation,  ﬁnancial services, 
and meaningful work. In Canada, our work is focused on 
Indigenou s youth  – the  youngest,  fastest growing 
population in the country, a tremendo us source of 
opportunity impact, and leade rship.The EleV Program
Indigenou s youth are powerful agents  of change for  thei r 
communities, Nations, and Canada as a who le.
The Foundation launched the EleV Program in Canada  in 
2017 as a commi tment to Indigenou s youth to  support 
them in their pathways through education and on to 
meaningful work and livelihoods based on their values, 
traditions, and aspirations. Our vision is of Indigenou s 
young peop le living Mino Bimaadiziwin, a  concept in  the  
Anishinaabe language that means  “a good life” – a fulﬁlling, 
meaningful life consistent with one’s traditions and values. 
Our goal is for education an d employment systems to be 
transformed to enab le 30, 000 Indigenous young peopl e 
to access post-secondary education and transition to 
meani ngful  live lihoods by  2030.  They w ill drive lasting 
impact and change in their communities and across Canada. 
At this historic moment of reconciliation in Canada, it’s  
important to work and act together. Indigenou s youth 
have told us that education is a key life goal. They seek 
high-qualit y post-secondary education opportunities, close 
to their community wher ever possible, and aligned with

core principles
Simplicity
Limit the number of weights and sizes to reduce 
visual noise and help the reader understand the 
hierarchy of information at a glance.
Balance
Typography should be direct and legible, while 
at the same time it should feel light on the 
page. Always assess the balance between 
blocks of type and the surrounding open space 
to engage the reader with a sense of ease.
Contrast
By carefully contrasting size, weight, and colour 
among related blocks of type, you’ll increase 
clarity for readers. Use contrast to express 
hierarchy, and to make a piece scannable, 
allowing readers to absorb relevant bits of 
information quickly.

creating contrast
Create contrast in one of two ways: through size 
or weight relationships. Both approaches work 
well, but use only one at a time in the application 
you’re creating.Contrast by size
Use a significant size change
between two components. In this
example, the headline is 70 pt and
the subtitle is 24 pt.
Contrast by weight
A clear change of weight provides
contrast when smaller sizes are
the best choice. In this example, the
headline is Bold and the text is
Book and both are 16 pt.Headline

Internal typography
All Internal Communications should follow the 
Mastercard Foundation brand standards for 
both colour and typography. 
While typically Mark for MC would be the default 
and recommended typeface for Mastercard 
Foundation projects, the primarily digital nature 
of Internal Communications precludes its use. 
As such, when Mark for MC font is not available, 
use Arial, which is available on all computer

Colour palette
The Mastercard Foundation Brand Mark colour 
palette consists of whites, warm grey, and dark-
grey tones with a touch of orange that feels 
modern, warm, and sophisticated. Add colour 
with care. In most situations, let the light or dark-
grey background dominate. Then use additional 
colour to augment what is being communicated, 
such as drawing attention to what is most 
important in the application.
There is an additional green colour for the 
program names. This colour is reserved 
exclusively for the program names artwork.

Colour / 
tints and shades
Tints and shades provide broad choices within 
the Mastercard Foundation brand palette. By 
working with the tints and shades of a single 
brand colour in an application, you’ll achieve a 
modern, simple sensibility.
Keep in mind that we want to preserve the 
vibrancy of the colours, so the primary colours 
should be dominant.
Note that the program name’s green colour 
should not be used in a screen or a tint.

Current palette colours are displayed with 
WCAG Level AA- and AAA-compliant variations. 
Variants were chosen from the existing colour 
palette shade/tint options as outlined in the 
Mastercard Foundation brand standards.
WCAG Level AA requires a minimum contrast 
ratio of 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large 
text. Level AAA requires a minimum contrast 
ratio of 7:1 for normal text and 4.5:1 for  
large text.
Large text is defined as 14-point bold or larger, or  
18-point regular or larger. Regular text is defined 
as sizes that are lower than 14-point bold or  
18-point regular. All values are referenced with

In today’s media-rich environment, people  
often look first to images and then to words.  
It is important, therefore, that each image  
be carefully selected to reflect the  
Foundation’s values.
The tone of photography should be human, 
natural, and aspirational. Photography should 
be highly saturated, authentic and have bright, 
vibrant colours. Images should capture people in 
their natural environment doing something  
they would normally do. 
Written or verbal consent must be obtained from 
people featured in photos prior to photo usage. 
Additionally, people featured in photography 
must be over 18 years of age. If people featured 
are under the age of 18, then consent must be 
obtained from the person’(s) legal guardian(s).
When using the Foundation’s photography,  
we ask that you obtain our permission and  
please credit the photo “[Photographer] for  
the Mastercard Foundation.”

Additional guidelines are as follows: 
Composition : Allow the primary subject to be the 
focus of each photo. Backgrounds and secondary 
subjects should form a cohesive relationship with 
the primary subject. 
Content : Photography should be authentic and 
natural. Avoid images that are overly staged. 
Brand vs. Secondary Imagery : Images used 
should be sourced from the Foundation’s photo 
library. If necessary, stock photos can be used to 
play a supporting visual role.
User-generated photos, such as those to the 
right, should follow the same principles, with 
good composition and authentic, natural 
expressions.Photography

Photography / 
black and white
Black and white photography has been used  
for the Secondary Education in Africa portfolio.
It is a good technique for bringing visual 
consistency to images supplied by multiple 
sources.
When converting a colour image to black and 
white, use the CMYK adjustments layer in 
Photoshop, rather than converting the image to 
greyscale, which would give a duller result.
Save the image as CMYK, and adjust the tones 
so that the blacks are rich, and there is detail and 
a variety of tones in darker areas.

Illustration
Illustration is an excellent way to communicate 
ideas or concepts visually. The Foundation 
sometimes employs illustration when 
communicating to youth and adult audiences, 
and for infographic purposes where necessary.
When appropriate, commission African and/or 
Indigenous illustrators. The illustrations should 
be authentic, representing cultures and diversity. 
The illustrator should use the Foundation’s colour 
palette as the primary colours.
The Mastercard Foundation illustration style 
should never be fictional, childish, cartoonlike or 
a caricature. We also discourage the use of stock 
or royalty-free illustration.

Universal
The purpose of icons is to represent activities or 
things in a universal way that can be understood 
regardless of language or culture. Mastercard 
Foundation icons are intended to function 
universally while not feeling overly generic.
Proprietary
The geometric forms of our icons reflect the 
sensibilities of our Brand Mark. Their stencil style 
provides an openness and simplicity that carries 
through the entirety of our brand expression. 
In those ways, our icons are proprietary to the 
Mastercard Foundation.
Simplicity
The simplicity you find throughout the 
Mastercard Foundation brand expression also 
defines our palette of icons. They are designed to 
fit as natural extensions of our typography with 
a clean drawing style that echoes our typefaces.
Icon use 
As pictograms, icons provide visual punctuation  
in combination with typography. They work  
well in user-interface situations to aid navigation 
by providing quick-read visual cues for a range  
of topics. 
Icons work best in small and medium sizes as an 
accompaniment to text. They should not be used 
as hero images, or as a replacement for imagery 
that typically illustrates communications.Icons /

Creating new icons
In some instances, the icons available in the 
library may not be a perfect fit for the need at 
hand. In that case, new icons can be created 
with the following rules in mind:
•  New icons should be line icons  
in the style of the existing icon library.
•  New icons should use the same line weight  
as the existing icons.
•  Icons should be simple and communicate  
at a glance.Here are some of the ready-to-use icons available 
through the Mastercard Design Center.

Simplicity
Our communications don’t exist in isolation. 
Rather, they compete with a digital and 
print onslaught that each of us faces every 
day. When the Mastercard Foundation 
communicates through simple, well-ordered 
layouts, we invite reader engagement, and 
provide a cohesive brand experience that can 
feel like calm in a storm.
Balance
Carefully balanced layouts guide a reader’s 
eye through a clear hierarchy of information. 
A thoughtful arrangement of elements makes 
it possible to scan a layout, helping readers to 
instantly understand the purpose and focus of 
the communication.
Contrast
By providing significant open space in a layout, 
you create contrast that brings clarity to the 
content of the communication. In the same 
way a frame sets a work of art apart from its 
surroundings, open space allows the eye to 
quickly take in the content.Layouts /  
core principles
However, young entrepreneurs are not 
simply using social media to get the word 
out about their businesses; they also 
mentioned that it presents a useful 
tool for engaging their customers. 
As a Kenyan entrepreneur said, “I try 
to communicate as much as possible 
with my customers.” Because customer 
relationships are so important for their 
businesses, young entrepreneurs are 
also finding social media a useful tool 
in building and maintaining customer 
relationships. Instead, young entrepreneurs most often 
report using an integrated approach 
— combining social media marketing 
with other more traditional marketing 
approaches. As a young Malawian 
entrepreneur selling kitchenware 
explained, “Sometimes I post them 
[pictures] on WhatsApp and Facebook. 
Sometimes, it’s physical: I can go out 
there and tell my customers that I have 
things in stock.” Other entrepreneurs 
similarly expressed that, while they had 
begun to use social media more often 
to advertise their business, they did 
not completely shift away from other 
marketing strategies because the market, 
or their customers, were not ready for a 
fully digital offer. 
Embracing technology in marketing is not 
just the preference of those with larger 
or more advanced businesses. Even those 
running small-scale businesses focused on 
selling goods and providing simple services 
are embracing digital marketing solutions, 
as are the customers that they are hoping 
to reach. Those seeking to support their 
growth could offer further instruction on 
best practices for how to use social media 
not just for brand promotion but also Because customer relationships 
are so important for their  
businesses, young entrepreneurs  
are also finding social media 
a useful tool in building 
and maintaining customer 
relationships. 
That said, some entrepreneurs whom 
we interviewed expressed that, while 
social media offers some advantages, 
it cannot always replace or replicate 
more traditional marketing channels. For 
example, a young Ghanaian running a 
lunch delivery service explained,  
“We tried [social media]. It gave us more 
visibility, but definitely, our target is the 
CBD [central business district]. So, it’s 
better [through] advertising, like business-
to-business, actually going there.” For this 
business owner, social media alone is not 
sufficient to reach their desired clients.

Brochures
Overview
This section details guidelines for brochures, 
which are less formal reports branded by 
the Foundation, and available publicly. In the 
past, these have been executive summaries 
for signature publications (where the full 
report is forthcoming but is not yet ready to go 
out), policy briefs focused on specific subject 
areas, brochures on partner projects, financial 
reports, etc. They have a cover, do not use 
rich photography but do have charts, process 
graphics, data visualization, and are saddle 
stitched or staple bound. These have shorter 
research/writing/production timelines lasting 
several days/weeks, and range from six to 10 
pages in length.
Covers have a full-bleed coloured band at 
the very bottom of the page, which also 
extends across the back cover. A heading that 
differentiates the brochure from the signature 
publication lives in this coloured band. The overall 
layout is the same as the signature publication 
so that they remain connected, but the band 
at the bottom with the heading provides 
differentiation.

Overview
This section details guidelines for internal 
documents, which are informal pieces meant to 
be shared internally only. They are documents 
that are self-written by staff, may be a “grey 
paper” containing preliminary findings and a 
working title, or a policy document placed on the 
intranet for staff reference. Such documents 
would typically be desktop published from a staff 
member’s computer with little or no external 
production support, and stapled in the top left 
corner, or published as a PDF only. There is a 
Microsoft Word document template with the 
typography system (using commonly available 
fonts, not the “Mark for MC” font), graphic 
styling, header/footer styling, cover page, table 
of contents, citations/end page.

Consecutive pages
Designed with the user in mind, the intention 
is to allow anyone to create this document 
on their desktop computer without the 
support of outside production. The result is 
a consistent, streamlined look for all internal 
communications. A two-column grid is ideal for 
this type of application. The line length remains 
pleasing to the eye and comfortable to read with 
the increased margins and gutter width. The 
document is set up as a user-friendly Microsoft 
Word template.This generation is healthier and better educated than their 
parents. Through technology, they have easier access to 
information, and consumer goods and services. The world they 
live in is more democratic. While the circumstances of their 
lives are measurably better than they were in the past, 
a signiﬁ  cant gap between the number of young people 
seeking work and the limited employment opportunities 
available to them means that they will face challenges ﬁ  nding 
formal employment and a pathway out of poverty. Moreover, 
for some time, we’ve observed a mismatch between the skills 
of young people entering the workforce and the needs of 
employers.  
The youth employment challenge is daunting, but it is not 
insurmountable.
THE MASTERCARD
FOUNDATION RESPONSE
We see the challenge of youth employment in Africa as an 
immense opportunity. Africa’s young people are innovative 
and energetic, and they are already creating solutions to 
the challenges they face. The time is right for the Foundation 
to focus on supporting them by driving systematic change 
in ﬁ  nancial inclusion and education to increase youth 
employment and reduce poverty. 
That is why, by 2030, our goal is to enable 30 million young 
people, particularly women, to secure employment that they 
see as digniﬁ  ed and fulﬁ  lling.
Our goal is part of our new strategy, Young Africa Works. 
Working toward it, we will:
Design Country-Speciﬁ  c Strategies: Improving education and 
vocational training, ﬁ  nding new ways to connect people with 
opportunity, and increasing ﬁ  nancial inclusion are all a part of 
the solution to the youth employment challenge. In addition, 
our approach will reﬂ  ect the unique challenges and 
opportunities of the countries in which we work.
Empower Young Women: Young women face gender-based 
barriers in skills development and in accessing work. Breaking 
down these barriers is essential to their success, and ours.The Youth
Employment Challenge
Africa is the youngest and fastest-
growing continent in the world.  
By 2030, there will be 375 million 
young people in the job market 
in Africa. Within a few decades, 
this demographic boom will push 
Africa’s workforce to more than 
a billion people, the largest in 
the world. 
While economic growth in many countries has been strong 
over the last 10 years, it has come with relatively few 
employment opportunities. According to the International 
Labour Organization, almost 80 percent of people in 
Africa work informally. Recent research undertaken by our 
Foundation in two countries in Africa found that among 
young people, very few had access to formal employment and 
most struggled to make a decent salary to live. When young 
people can secure formal work and a steady wage, their lives 
improve. Employment, particularly formal employment, is a 
leading pathway out of poverty for families. In Africa, the 
world’s youngest continent, youth employment is a particularly 
important measure of poverty reduction.
important measure of poverty reduction.
BY 2100, ALMOST HALF OF THE WORLD’S YOUTH
WILL BE AFRICANIn light of the scale and 
complexity of Africa’s youth 
employment challenge, no one 
organization can address 
it alone. We must program 
holistically and work with African 
governments, the private sector, 
educators, and other funders. 
More cooperation with the formal 
private sector will be needed, as 
will increased levels of ﬁ  nancial 
inclusion. The modernization of 
the agricultural sector and other 
critical growth sectors is key. 
Supporting African institutions 
to advance change in individual 
countries will be essential, as will 
advancing global discussions on 
youth employment in Africa.Work with More African Organizations: On-the-ground 
knowledge and expertise is the bedrock of the Foundation’s 
work. Partnering with African-led organizations active in 
seeking solutions to youth employment is a priority.
Use Technology to Drive Impact and Scale: Technology 
has the power to connect young people to their ﬁ  rst job, 
apprenticeships, and cooperative programs. It also enables 
faster, more eﬃ   cient access to capital, talent, and business 
support for entrepreneurs. It drives growth, inclusion, 
and poverty reduction.
Share More Evidence-Based Knowledge and Innovation:
In a rapidly changing work environment, data-driven, creative 
solutions are needed. We will ﬁ  nd new insights and share them 
with others to magnify our impact. 
The Young Africa Works strategy is a continuation of our 
decade-old collaboration with Africa’s youth. Their voices and 
insights have guided us as we have developed this strategy. 
Through them, we have learned that:
•Young people want to drive change. They want to be more 
than just beneﬁ  ciaries of programs; this generation wants
to be job creators. Their input is critical in the development
of programs, policies, and decisions that aﬀ  ect youth
employment.
•They have a vision for a more inclusive future. Over and
over, young people have told us to be bold in our goals.
Young women, rural youth, and refugees face additional
barriers in gaining employment. The Foundation will do
more to break down walls of inequality and empower the
most vulnerable young people to succeed.
•They believe in the power of innovation and technology.
Young people not only want to be equipped with the skills
they need to leverage current technology, they want to
lead in the development of the technology of tomorrow.
To that end, we will bolster support to Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education as we
move forward.
In light of the scale and 
AFRICA IS THE ONLY CONTINENT WHERE THE 
YOUTH POPULATION WILL ALMOST TRIPLE BY 2100

Design elements
Gradient Keylines
The keyline is a gradient of Mastercard Orange 
and Mastercard Yellow. The keyline must be 
a 10-pt weight, and lives at the top of each 
consecutive page like a running header. The 
footer keyline is two-point and should adhere to 
the same widths. 
Case Studies
To highlight important text, such as a case 
study, use a Mastercard Yellow background 
with 20% tint and place the text on top in 
black. Use the left column to define the case 
study or place a title, and use the right column 
to place the body text.
Call-outs
Use the gradient keyline at a 1.1671" length  
(half the width of the left-hand column) above 
Mastercard Orange text.Be careful how you 
calculate. Bad indicators 
can distort reality.Say you have a job training program that reports a 60% 
completion rate (that’s pretty good, right?!) Not so fast. 
Where did they get that number? Well, they reported that of 
100 enrolees who completed the course and signed up for a 
job, 60 ended up starting work. That’s not nothing, but what 
about those who didn’t complete the course? And is completion 
the important data point? Shouldn’t it be those who are still 
employed? In this example, 100 additional folks started the 
course, but dropped out before it ended. What’s more, of the 
60 who completed the program and started working, only 30 
were still employed after one year. So what is reported as a 
60% completion rate, is actually only 15%, when we look at 
the whole sample, a longer time frame, and the relevant data 
point. We need to be careful about the numbers that comprise 
the numerator and the denominator of the indicator to ensure 
a reasonable number is reported. CASE
