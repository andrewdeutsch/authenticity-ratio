### Recommended Actions

1. **Enhance Provenance Verification:**
   - Implement a process to verify the sources of content shared by testbrand. This could involve cross-referencing claims made in posts with credible external sources or studies. Aim to achieve a provenance score improvement from 0.500 to 0.650 within 4 weeks.

2. **Increase Transparency in Content Creation:**
   - Clearly disclose the authorship of content, including the credentials of contributors. This is particularly critical for posts that share expert opinions or data. Set a target to improve the transparency score from 0.500 to 0.600 in 4 weeks.

3. **Boost Coherence Across Platforms:**
   - Ensure that messaging is consistent across all platforms, particularly in terms of brand values and product information. Conduct a review of existing content and align messaging. Aim for a coherence score improvement from 0.500 to 0.600 within 6 weeks.

4. **Engage with the Audience for Resonance:**
   - Create interactive content (polls, Q&As) that encourages audience participation and feedback. This will help improve the resonance score from 0.500 to 0.600 in 4 weeks. 

5. **Verification of User-Generated Content:**
   - For any user-generated content shared by testbrand, implement a verification step to confirm authenticity before posting. This will enhance both verification and provenance scores. Aim for a verification score improvement from 0.500 to 0.600 in 4 weeks.

6. **Regular Content Audits:**
   - Conduct a monthly audit of content to assess its trustworthiness and authenticity. This will help in identifying and addressing any low-trust items systematically. 

### Next Steps (concrete)

**Low Trust items (examples):**
1. **[Low Trust Item 1 URL]**
   - Context: This post lacks clear sourcing for its claims about product effectiveness, which can mislead consumers and diminish trust.

2. **[Low Trust Item 2 URL]**
   - Context: The author of this post is not identified, making it difficult for readers to assess the credibility of the information shared.

- Immediate (1-7 days):
  1. Review and improve metadata for the identified low-trust posts, ensuring accurate authorship and sourcing.
  2. Create a checklist for content creation that includes steps for verifying sources and authorship.

- Short-term (1-4 weeks):
  1. Implement a transparency report for all new content published, detailing sources and author credentials.
  2. Train the content team on best practices for verifying information and maintaining coherence across platforms.

- Medium (4-12 weeks):
  1. Develop a comprehensive content strategy that incorporates audience feedback and focuses on improving resonance through tailored content.
  2. Establish partnerships with credible sources to enhance the provenance of shared content, aiming for a long-term goal of a provenance score of 0.700.

### Success Metrics

1. **Provenance Score Improvement:**
   - Target to increase the provenance score from 0.500 to 0.650 within 4 weeks.

2. **Transparency Score Improvement:**
   - Aim to enhance the transparency score from 0.500 to 0.600 in 4 weeks.

3. **Coherence and Resonance Scores:**
   - Set a goal to improve both coherence and resonance scores from 0.500 to 0.600 within 6 weeks.

4. **Reduction of Low Trust Items:**
   - Aim to reduce low trust items from 1 to 0 by addressing identified issues within 7 days.

5. **Overall Trust Average Improvement:**
   - Target to improve the overall trust average from 0.500 to 0.600 within 12 weeks through consistent application of the recommended actions.

**Source**: Brave  
**Score**: 50.00 (Moderate Trust)  
**URL**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=web_0_600706448767043285

**Dimensional Performance**:
- Strongest: Provenance (0.50)
- Weakest: Provenance (0.50), Resonance (0.50)

**Rationale**: Low signals in Provenance (0.50), Resonance (0.50) contributed to the lower score. The site lacks visible Terms/Privacy links which reduces trust signals. Missing open-graph metadata reduced the detectable content richness. LLM classified this item as suspect (conf=0.6).
